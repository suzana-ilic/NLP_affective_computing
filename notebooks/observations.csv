i feel like i had a rather productive weekend and i cant always say that no matter how much i get done
im feeling insecure at the moment
i was feeling pretty anxious all day but my first day at work was a very good day and that helped a lot
i stood up to you i finally stood up to you and now i feel like im being punished if i could go back and do it again
i feel a little nervous i go to the gym
i feel like i could go into any situation and become successful because i ve been competing all my life explained schaub in an interview with the a href http bleacherreport
i can t stop the anxiety i feel when i m alone when i ve got no distractions
im trying to feel out my house style now that im living on my own and have creative carte blanche
i have tried to see what it would be like if i liked one of my girl friends but it has never really worked and i can only ever feel an emotional connection to them because they are my friends
i had every intention of doing more gardening this morning while it was still cool but i was just feeling so rotten
i have a good feeling about this so i am excited
i feel like i am just starting to understand the blessings that come from being submissive to the will of the father
i think about the things ive said and the stuff i have done it makes me feel disgusted in myself when i should be making you happy and smile which i was far from doing
i woke up yesterday monday morning feeling a little depressed
i feel so embarrassed
